<h4>(I) Why Call Recorder could not able to record opponents voice?</h4>
<pre>
There is many vendors for mobile devices and they made their device specific to their configuration.
Since there are some countries where recording of calls are banned, that's why device manufacturer companies do not give feature to record opponents voice.
But, you could choose different option for your best suits. You can enable loudspeaker to record opponents voice properly.
</pre>
<h4>(II) Why Call Recorder records only first 30 seconds (or some minutes) of conversation?</h4>
<pre>
In some phones it depends on phone setting:  “Screen Timeout” (or it can be similar to this). Please try to set the value of it as big as possible.
</pre>
<h4>(III) If I delete, Is it possible to restore the recordings?</h4>
<pre>All the records are stored only in the SD card of the phone. Selected record is deleted permanently from this folder when you delete it from application.For now, there is no way to restore it.
</pre>
<h4>(IV) What is the use of password protection in this app?</h4>
<pre>
This feature is given as per some users requirements. You can use it to prevent your personal recordings to others.
</pre>
<h4>(V) App is not recording calls at all, why ? </h4>
<pre>
- Due to hardware limitations recording function might not work properly on some devices. It is not malfunction of the application.
- App may not function if other call recording applications are in use. Please close or delete all other recording apps.
